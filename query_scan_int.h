 *
 * This file declares the QueryScanStateData structure used by query_scan.l.
 *
 * Another interesting thing we do here is scan different parts of the same
 * input with physically separate flex lexers (ie, lexers written in separate
 * .l files).  We can get away with this because the only part of the
 * persistent state of a flex lexer that depends on its parsing rule tables
 * is the start state number, which is easy enough to manage --- usually,
 * in fact, we just need to set it to INITIAL when changing lexers.  But to
 * make that work at all, we must use re-entrant lexers, so that all the
 * relevant state is in the yyscan_t attached to the QueryScanState;
 * if we were using lexers with separate static state we would soon end up
 * with dangling buffer pointers in one or the other.  Also note that this
 * is unlikely to work very nicely if the lexers aren't all built with the
 * same flex version, or if they don't use the same flex options.
